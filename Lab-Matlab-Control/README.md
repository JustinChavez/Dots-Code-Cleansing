Custom utilities for experimental control for the Gold Lab

## What you need:
- The files contained within Lab-Matlab-Control and Lab-Matlab-Utilities
- MGL. Which can be downloaded from this link: http://gru.stanford.edu/doku.php/mgl/overview
- PsychToolbox: http://psychtoolbox.org

- It's important to note that the lastest version of Matlab that Snow-Dots will work properly on is 2013a. If you must install this version of Matlab and are running on Apples latest OS, you will likely encouter an error when trying to run it. Please go to this link https://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/1098655 and complete the appropriate steps to patch up your 2013a version of Matlab.
